  <h1>Troop Training and Promotion Guide</h1>

  <h2>Troop Training vs. Promotion</h2>
    <p>
      The first priority is to ensure you have enough troops to fill all your marches.
      Training new troops is the only way to increase troop count
    </p>
    <p>
      Once that is satisified, you should try to promote up lower troops. This has a number of benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a small power benefit to promoting lower troops over training new ones.
          It only applies up to three levels below your current level. For example, if you can
          train T9 troops then you get a boost for promoting T6 and below. T7 and T8 promotion
          give the same power as training new T9, so you don't lose anything here, you just don't
          get the boost
        </li>
        <li>
          When you fight, your lower troops will get injured first. If they fill up your infirmary
          then when your higher level troops get injured, they will die
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Promotion is valuable during events like Hall of Governors, as you can get many more promoted in
      a single pass than trained from scratch
    </p>

  <h2>Recommended Troop Numbers by Town Center Level</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Town Center Level</th><th>Recommended Troop Count</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>TC 20</td><td>200,000 – 250,000</td><td>Train high-tier troops; two full marches.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TC 22</td><td>250,000 – 300,000</td><td>Begin troop promotions during events.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TC 24</td><td>300,000 – 400,000</td><td>Focus on Tier 8 troops; promote T7.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TC 26</td><td>400,000 – 500,000</td><td>Strive for Tier 9 dominance.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TC 28</td><td>500,000 – 600,000</td><td>Prepare to transition to Tier 10.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>TC 30</td><td>600,000+</td><td>Maximize Tier 10 and fine-tune formations.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Take this with a pinch of salt I got chatGPT to summarise the advice on reddit for this</p>

  <h2>Troop Composition and Formations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>General PvP:</strong> 5/2/3 or 6/2/2 (Infantry/Cavalry/Archers).</li>
    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> 5/4/1 for sturdy defensive setups.</li>
    <li><strong>Bear Trap Events:</strong> 1/1/10 to maximize archer damage.</li>
  </ul>
