  <h1>Events</h1>

  <h2>Bear Pit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled every 2 days (time TBC)</li>
    <li>Half an hour of rallying</li>
    <li>You need to be by the bear pit to take part</li>
    <li>Rally with your highest &amp; best troops</li>
    <li>Join any other rallies with other troops, look for the rallies with shortest time to get more rallies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Viking's Vengeance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>20 Waves of attacks from Vikings that get increasingly strong</li>
    <li>Waves 10 and 20 will attack the plains HQ so make sure you reinforce (do we have a priority on this?)</li>
    <li>Make sure you heal every round of attacks</li>
    <li>If you are defeated by the Vikings, put out the fire in the Command Centre</li>
    <li>If you are defeated twice, you are out but you can still reinforce people who are still in, so do that</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Alliance Championship</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An auto-attacker battle against another clan</li>
    <li>We move up and down leagues based on results, so will gradually meet bigger and better clans</li>
    <li>Not much for you to do other than register for the event!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Swordland Showdown</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A mini-battle against another clan in a private map, over half an hour</li>
    <li>We can have up to two legions fighting at the same time</li>
    <li>You can teleport around the map, these are limited but you get more through the battle</li>
    <li>You can attack other players and the buildings</li>
    <li>Win the buildings and hold them to gain points</li>
    <li>Garrison the important buildings to help hold them</li>
    <li>There are mines that pop up randomly on the map. Get them, they are useful</li>
    <li>If you hold a building rebels will also attack you and weaken the garrisoned troops</li>
    <li>Troop losses are a big issue in this game, effective healing is an important aspect</li>
    <li>idk about this one really, it's a bit of a free for all every time I've done it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Eternity's Reach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mine mines, there are three levels</li>
    <li>You will need to defeat rebels to get to the mines</li>
    <li>A quiet area of the map is good to avoid competition. Use your teleports wisely</li>
  </ul>
