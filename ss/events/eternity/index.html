  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  
  <h4>Before the match starts</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Recall all your troops, you cannot enter without having them all back</li>
	<li>Once you spawn on the battlefield, there‚Äôs a 2-minute 30-second countdown before the action begins</li>
	<li>Zoom out and scan the map</li>
	<li>If your area looks too crowded, teleport to a better spot (when the battle begin) where it‚Äôll be easier to find and kill guards early on</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Early game - hunting guards</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Focus on killing Cesare‚Äôs Guards</li>
	<li>Prioritize Level 2 Guards ‚Äì they give more XP</li>
	<li>Use the Search button to find guards quickly</li>
	<li>Skip guards that are already being attacked and move on to another</li>
	<li>Your main goal here is to earn XP and level up your skill tree</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Skill Tree Upgrade Order</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Recomended upgrade path is R-R-L-L-R</li>
	<li>Level 1 (Right) Defeating a guard gives you 1,500 Copper</li>
	<li>Level 2 (Right) Increases March Speed by 25%.Occupy a vein with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus</li>
	<li>Level 3 (Left) Gives 5,000 Copper every time you occupy a vein. Has a 60-second cooldown. ‚úÖ This is the most important skill</li>
	<li>Level 4 (Left) Boosts gathering efficiency by 20%.Occupy a vein with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus</li>
	<li>Level 5 (Right) Increases gathering speed by 50 for 60 seconds for all marches that are gathering ‚è≥ This one needs to be activated manually!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Mid Game ‚Äì Farming &amp; upgrading</h4>
  <ul>
	<li>Once you unlock the 5,000 Copper skill</li>
	<li>Occupy a vein with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus</li>
	<li>After getting the bonus, recall the march and send it again a minute later</li>
	<li>Make sure to remember the time you last sent a march to a vein so you can send another one right after the cooldown ends and get the 5,000 Copper bonus again. You can use the event timer as a reference to keep track of it</li>
	<li>While doing this, continue attacking guards and upgrading your skills using the same R-R-L-L-R path</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Late Game ‚Äì Farming</h4>
  <ul>
	<li>Once you unlock the final skill, focus on gathering from Level 2 veins (Level 3s are usually taken by whales). Try to control as many Level 2 veins as you can. If no Level 2 Vein is available, go after Level 1 Vein</li>
	<li>Remember: the last skill must be activated manually, so only trigger it when all your marches are gathering</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Late Game ‚Äì Fractured Vein Outbursts</h4>
  <ul>
	<li>If you‚Äôre actively hunting guards, you‚Äôll max out your skill tree before the Fracture Vein Outburst happens</li>
	<li>üí• Fractured Veins are super important ‚Äì they give 200 Copper/second, compared to just 16/second from Level 2 veins</li>
	<li>A few seconds before the Outburst (you will get a warning) recall all your troops</li>
	<li>Once it begins, rush to occupy as many Fracture Veins as possible</li>
	<li>After the Outburst ends, go back to gathering from Level 2 veins</li>
	<li>Keep using the manual gathering boost and 5000 Copper bonus skill</li>
  </ul>
