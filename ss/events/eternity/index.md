# Eternity's Reach

Mine ore to win. You can sign up for one of 8 time slots through the day for an individual challenge
It takes half an hour of real time. You will be in a private map with about 100 other players, from different servers

## Strategy

### Before the match starts
- Recall all your troops, you cannot enter without having them all back
- Once you spawn on the battlefield, there‚Äôs a 2-minute 30-second countdown before the action begins
- Zoom out and scan the map
- Look for a spot in the level 2 mines, with 2 or 3 mines close together
- Teleport right next to one mine
- If your area looks too crowded, teleport to a better spot. Being in an uncontested area is worthwhile in this game

### Early game - hunting guards & upgrade skills
- Focus on killing Cesares Guards. Ignore the mines completely
- Use the Search button to find guards quickly
- Skip guards that are already being attacked and move on to another
- Prioritize Level 2 Guards ‚Äì they give more XP. But take down Level 1 guards if that's all you find
- Your only goal here is to earn XP, and level up your skill tree

### Skill Tree Upgrade Order
- Recomended upgrade path is **R-R-L-L-R**
- Level 1 (**Right**) Defeating a guard gives you 1,500 Copper
- Level 2 (**Right**) Increases March Speed by 25%. Occupy a mine with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus
- Level 3 (**Left**) ‚úÖ **This is the most important skill** Gives 5,000 Copper every time you occupy a mine. Has a 60-second cooldown 
- Level 4 (**Left**) Boosts gathering efficiency by 20%. Occupy a mine with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus
- Level 5 (**Right**) Increases gathering speed by 50 for 60 seconds for all marches that are gathering. ‚ö†Ô∏è This one needs to be activated manually!

### Mid Game ‚Äì Farming & upgrading
- Move onto this once you unlock the 5,000 Copper skill (level 3)
- Occupy the mine you are right next to with one march every 60 seconds to get the bonus.
You can keep reoccupying the same mine for the bonus, you don't need to find new mines
- After getting the bonus, recall the march and send it again a minute later
- Make sure to remember the time you last sent a march to the mine so you can send another one right after the cooldown ends and get the 5,000 Copper bonus again. Use the event timer as a reference to keep track of it
- While doing this, continue attacking guards and upgrading your skills using the same R-R-L-L-R path

### Late Game ‚Äì Max Skill Tree
- Even though the skill tree is maxed out, it is still worth attacking the guards
- Your Level 1 skill gives you 1,500 copper for killing a guard, whereas you only get 16/s copper mining a level 2 mine.
That's over a minute and a half's mining for each guard kill
- At this point you are killing guards for points and the level doesn't matter. A level 1 guard gives the same bonus as a level 2 guard.
Feel free to teleport out to the outside where there is less competition
- Ignore the centre, unless you are a whale you won't compete, so don't bother
- Keep sending one march every 60 seconds to the mine that is right next to you

### Late Game ‚Äì Fractured Vein Outbursts
- If you‚Äôre actively hunting guards, you‚Äôll max out your skill tree before the Fracture Vein Outburst happens
-üí• Fractured Veins are super important ‚Äì they give 200 copper/s
- A few seconds before the Outburst (you will get a warning), recall all your troops.
If you are attacking guards, your troops should be coming back all the time anyway.
Just don't send out a march a long way away shortly before it starts
- Just before it begins, activate the level 5 skill for even better mining rate. It will be active for the next minute
- Once it begins, rush to occupy as many Fracture Veins as possible
- Consider teleporting if there are no Fracture Veins around you, just make sure to go next to a mine
- Keep sending one march every 60 seconds to the mine that is right next to you
- Once it is over, go back to hunting guards again
