  <h2>Alliance Championship</h2>
  <p>
    An auto-attacker battle against another clan. We move up and down leagues based on results, so will gradually meet bigger and better clans
  </p>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Not much for you to do other than register for the event!</li>
	<li>Having good troops and heroes helps, so keep training all the time</li>
	<li>For the R4s the rough plan is to stack more attacking power onto two lanes and hope that they win, as we only need win two out of three lanes to win the match</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Rewards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Championship Badge (use in Alliance Championship shop)</li>
  </ul>
