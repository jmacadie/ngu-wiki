  <h1>All Out</h1>
  
  <p>
    A very dangerous event where you gain points from attacking other players. This is dangerous because it brings out the whales, who can flatten all of us.
	If you don't follow the agreed rules (and even if you do but get unlucky), people can get upset and wars can break out, which is bad for everyone.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you are up to date with the current rules on what is and is not ok to attack</li>
	<li>If needs be, buy a shield and wait it out. Better be safe than sorry as being zeroed is no fun</li>
	<li>
	  If you send troops out to farm they are very likely to get attacked. Keep an eye on them and recall before the attacker arrives.
	  If you can't do that, it's best not to farm during this event. If you get attacked (and defeated) all collected resource for that tile will be lost.
	  If you recall, you get to keep what you have collected to date.
	</li>
	<li>If you see a team member city being attacked, shout out on alliance chat and reinforce them</li>
	<li>You don't have to attack much to max out the standard (non-leader board) rewards</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Rewards</h3>
