# Castle Battle

The battle for who will be king of the server 
There are 5 buildings in play: the castle and four turrets, each of which can be rallied and, if won, garrisoned.
The battle will last 6 hours, although can end early

## Strategy

There are really two sets of objectives here:
1. Winning the castle as an alliance, and
2. Getting personal points

The single most important factor driving success for either strategy is **we need lots of the alliance online throughout the battle
all clicking the alliance help button** so that we can reliably [batch heal](/healing) in large chunks and keep injury levels
under control

An important note: you never get outright troop losses when attacking or defending any of the 5 castle buildings.
You will only ever get injuries, but these can become losses if your infirmary over-fills

### Winning the castle
- Winning the castle involves our alliance being in control of the castle for longer than any other alliance over the 6 hour battle
- If one alliance holds the castle for 3 continuous hours then the battle will end imediately, bringing the battle to an early conclusion
- The castle victor is often pre-arranged, in which case expect the battle to be over within 3 hours
- This is [a standard garrisoning situation](/rallies#garrisoning), and reinforcing is especially important
- The garrisoned troops can expect to lose power to constant attacks from plyers, which will be worse if the castle is being actively contested
- In addition, the turrets fire on castle every 4 minutes. They will not fire if they are controlled by the same alliance as is in the castle
- The turrets have at a loss rate of 2% of the troops garrisoning the castle each, so all 4 firing on you would give injury losses 8%
- However, with each turret attack on the castle, the timer between attacks drops by 1 minute.
4 mins -> 3 mins -> 2 mins -> 1 min.
The firing rate is only reset down by the castle-controlling alliance also taking control of the turret.
So after 9 minutes of not controlling a turret, it will be giving 2% losses every minute, all 4 would be giving 8% every minute.
It is very hard to out-heal that amount of losses, and this is not even counting the losses from other player attacks and rallies
- This is why in a pre-agreed battle, the castle-occupying alliance will periodically need to take control of each turret
- In a contested battle, [effective rallies, with multiple timed attacks](/rallies) is essentail to take control of the castle

### Personal points
- If the alliance is not in the hunt for the overall castle, which is often the case, you should still be competeng for personal points
- Personal points are what give you the event rewards which are a frankly rediculous amount of charm upgrade materials. It is super worthwhile
- You get personal points for one of three things: KO points (injuring other players), Occupation points (for taking and holding buildings)
and Injury points (for the injuries your own troops suffer)
- Of the three, you can easily score very well just from personal injury points. Send in a doomed solo attack on the castle and collect back your
30% guaranteed losses
- This strategy will fill your infirmary very quickly, so it is imperative that you keep a close eye on its capacity and hold back on sending new
attacks that would push you over the limit
- Capturing and holding a turret (or two) is fun and a change of scene, but because _you can only have one march in effect_ it is usually
more effective to just be injuring & then healing back your own troops. Holding a turrent while you are in a healing phase can be a useful
source of additional points
