  <h1>Castle Battle</h1>
  
  <p>
    There are 5 buildings in play: he castle and four turrets, each of which can be rallied and, if won, garrisoned.
    The battle will last 6 hours, although can end early
  </p>
  
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    There are really two sets of objectives here:<br />
    1) Winning the castle as an alliance, and<br />
    2) Getting personal points
  </p>
  <h4>Winning the castle</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Winning the castle involves our alliance being in control of the castle for longer than any other alliance over the 6 hour battle</li>
    <li>If one alliance holds the castle for 3 continuous hours then the battle will end imediately, bringing the battle to an early conclusion</li>
    <li>The castle victor is often pre-arranged, in which case expect the battle to be over within 3 hours</li>
    <li>This is <a href="/rallies#garrisoning">a standard garrisoning situation</a>, and reinforcing is especially important</li>
    <li>The garrisoned troops can expect to lose power to constant attacks from plyers, which will be worse if the castle is being actively contested</li>
    <li>In addition, the turrets fire on castle every [5] minutes. They will not fire if they are controlled by the same alliance as is in the castle</li>
    <li>
      The turrets start at a loss rate of 2% each, so all 4 firing on you would give injury losses 8%.
      However, this steadily increases up to [10%] per turret not controlled.
      The loss rate is only reset down by the castle-controlling alliance taking control of the turret, or a change of the alliance in the castle
    </li>
    <li>This is why in a pre-agreed battle, the castle-occupying alliance will periodically need to take control of each turret</li>
    <li>In a contested battle, <a href="/rallies">effective rallies, with multiple timed attacks</a> is essentail to take control of the castle</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Personal points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If the alliance is not in the hunt for the overall castle, which is often the case, you should still be competeng for personal points</li>
    <li>Personal points are what give you the event rewards which are a frankly rediculous amount of charm upgrade materials. It is super worthwhile</li>
    <li>
      You get personal points for one of three things: KO points (injuring other players), Occupation points (for taking and holding buildings)
      and Injury points (for the injuries your own troops suffer)
    </li>
    <li>
      Of the three, you can easily score very well just from personal injury points. Send in a doomed solo attack on the castle and collect back your
      30% guaranteed losses
    </li>
    <li>
      This strategy will fill your infirmary very quickly, so it is imperative that you keep a close eye on its capacity and hold back on sending new
      attacks that would push you over the limit
    </li>
    <li>
      All of which brings us to the single most important factor driving success: <strong>we need lots of the alliance online throughout the battle
      all clicking the alliance help button</strong> so that we can reliably <a href="/healing">batch heal</a> in large chunks and keep injury levels
      under control
    </li>
    <li>
      Capturing and holding a turret (or two) is fun and a change of scene, but because <em>you can only have one march in effect</em> it is usually
      more effective to just be injuring & then healing back your own troops. Holding a turrent while you are in a healing phase can be a useful
      source of additional points
    </li>
  </ul>
