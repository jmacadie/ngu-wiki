# Viking Vengeance

20 Waves of attacks from Vikings that get increasingly strong. Every player is attacked in each wave, bar 10 and 20.
Waves 10 and 20 will attack the plains HQ. If you are defeated in any two rounds, you are out and the vikings will
no longer attack you

## Strategy

### Before the event
- Strategy is to send out all your troops &amp; heroes, except your 3 best heroes
- Make a squad of 62k of your strongest troops and send to reinforce a friend. Remember, which friend you sent them to
- Divide your remaining troops evenly between the number of march queues you have left
- Divide all but the 3 heroes that stay home have between the reinforcements you send out, it doesn't much matter how you allocate this
- Send out these remaining troops to reinforce other castles
- Aim is to get 200k troops in every castle. If you have too many expell some and if you have too few ask on alliance chat
- Everyone should have at least one proper squad of T8 or T9 troops to ensure decent defence
- R4s will check before the event that troop distribution is ok
- Once done, you will <strong>only have 3 heroes in your castle and no troops</strong>, plus c 200k reinforcements

### During the event
- **DO NOT HEAL YOUR TROOPS**. It's odd advice but it messes up the points allocation if you do
- After you are certain waves 9 and 19 have finished making their attack on your friend from above (the one you remembered ðŸ˜‰), recall just that squad
- Once back home, send it out to the HQ to garrison. Not everyone will be able to fit, so you may bounce back
- After you are certain waves 10 and 20 have made their attack on the HQ (be aware they are slow!) you can recall your troops from the HQ
- For wave 11, send your squad back to the friend you recalled them from, so that they have the same cover for waves 11 to 19
- If you are defeated twice, expell all garrisoned troops from your castle, so that players can send them out to protect castles that are still in
- After all waves are over, recall your troops and we can get [batch healing](/healing)
