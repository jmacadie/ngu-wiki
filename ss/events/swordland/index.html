  <h2>Swordland Showdown</h2>
  
  <p>
    A real-time mini-battle against one other clan in a private map, over half an hour. We can have up to two legions fighting at the same time.
	Each legion can have up to 30 main fighters and 10 substitues. Each player can only play in one legion.
	Win control of and hold buildings to accumulate points. The team with the most points at the end wins
  </p>
  
  <h3>Phases of battle</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Phase 0: Prep in neutral zone</li>
	<li>Phase 1: Fight for basic buildings: Sanctums, Abbeys, Bell Tower, and the Royal Stables</li>
	<li>Phase 2: Stronger buildings become available: Swordshrine, Hall of Reformation, and Mercenary Camp </li>
	<li>Phase 3: Undercellers appear randomly</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Buildings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Swordshrine (Center): The center of Swordland Showdown Map. Produces continuous Relic Points</li>
    <li>Sanctums: Near the Swordshrine. Control both for even more points</li>
    <li>Abbeys: Give points over time</li>
    <li>Hall of Reformation: Boosts your combat power</li>
    <li>Belltower: Speeds up building captures</li>
    <li>Royal Stables: Shortens teleport cooldown by 50%</li>
    <li>Mercenary Camp: Lets you send mercenaries to hit enemy buildings</li>
    <li>Undercellers: Appear in waves. Loot them for big point boosts</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Only sign up if you are sure you will show at the allotted time. No shows are costly for the team</li>
    <li>Make sure your troops are not marching, healing, and reinforcing before starting</li>
	<li>Use labels on the map to co-ordinate everyone</li>
	<li>Use teams, to give people a role in the battle</li>
	<li>Have one person in charge of comms, setting new markers and keeping an eye on the time for transitions. They can be less active in the fight. If using teams, make this a defender</li>
    <li>You can teleport around the map, these are limited but you get more through the battle. The holding the stables helps with this</li>
    <li>You can attack other players and the buildings</li>
    <li>Garrison the important buildings to help hold them</li>
    <li>There are mines that pop up randomly on the map. Get them, they are useful</li>
    <li>Troop losses are a big issue in this game, bring healing speedups as batch healing does not work here</li>
	<li>If your troops are wiped, you can retreat and come back after 12 minutes to get them all back</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Teams Strategy</h3>
  
  <h4>Setting Up</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Divide into three teams of roughly one third each: Attackers, Support & Defenders</li>
    <li>Strongest player goes into the Support team</li>
	<li>Next strongest players (8 to 10 depending on turn-out) all go into the Attack team. Attack team’s job is to reduce enemy troop numbers, which makes it easier for others to take and hold buildings</li>
	<li>Next strongest players (7 to 9 depending on turn-out) all go into the Support team, with our top dog</li>
	<li>Remaining players (8 to 10 depending on turn-out) all go into the Defenders team</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Phase 1 Strategy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Support team helps Defenders capture key buildings. Priority targets: Belltower and Royal Stables</li>
    <li>Attack team focuses on hitting enemy players to weaken their troops</li>
	<li>Once the Attack team runs low on troops, they retreat to heal (12 min cooldown)</li>
	<li>During that time, Support takes over attacking</li>
	<li>Once Attackers are healed, everyone switches back to their original roles</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Phase 2 Strategy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Swordshrine opens during this phase but ignore it for now, we will get to in the Phase 3. The goal here is to control other buildings and rack up Relic Points</li>
    <li>Split the Defender team in two: Half hold Belltower, 1 Sanctum, and 2 Abbeys. Other half hold Royal Stables, the other Sanctum, and 2 more Abbeys</li>
	<li>Attackers keep pressuring the enemy</li>
	<li>Support helps capture or defend buildings as needed</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Phase 3 Strategy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Phase 3 is when it is time to target Swordshrine (center). It’s not necessary to win, but helps a lot</li>
    <li>Don’t rush it; wait until the last 10 minutes, when the enemy likely has 15–30k points</li>
	<li>Defender team keep holding the outer buildings</li>
	<li>Attack and Support teams teleport around the Swordshrine in a circle</li>
	<li>Use coordinated rallies: Attack team starts a rally, Support team follows with their rally a few seconds later</li>
	<li>Keep doing this until you capture the shrine and steal their gathering points</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Rewards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Forge Hammer</li>
    <li>Enhancement XP Part</li>
    <li>Alliance Token</li>
  </ul>
