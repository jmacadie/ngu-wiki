# Swordland Showdown

A real-time mini-battle against one other clan in a private map, over one hour.
We can have up to two legions fighting at the same time.
Each legion can have up to 30 main fighters and 10 substitutes. Each player can only play in one legion.
Win control of and hold buildings to accumulate points. The team with the most points at the end wins

## Buildings

### Available from the start
- Royal Stables: Shortens teleport cooldown by 50%
- Belltower: Speeds up building captures
- Sanctums: Give points over time. Worth twice as much as an abbey
- Abbeys: Give points over time

### Available from 15 mins
- Hall of Reformation: Boosts your combat power
- Mercenary Camp: Lets you send mercenaries to hit enemy buildings

### Available from 20 mins
- Swordshrine: The biggest building in the event with the most points, but no buffs

### Available from 30 mins
- Undercellers: Appear in 3 waves at 30:00, 40:00 and 50:00. Loot them for big point boosts

## Teleporting
- You have unlimited teleports in the match but will be restricted from using them by a timer
- After each teleport you will need to wait 10 minutes before you can teleport again
- If our alliance controls the Royal Stables, the cool-down is reduced to 5 mins
- Since mobility is crucial in this event, controlling the Royal Stables is a very high priority

## Healing
- Troops lost or injured in this event will not affect your troops outside of the event.
Do not worry about being wiped out and losing power in the main game
- If you lose troops in the event, you can use normal healing in the infirmary.
You cannot batch heal with ally assists, so your healing will most likely not keep up with troop losses.
It will be tempting to use healing speedups or diamonds to get your troops back but unless you be whaling there's a better way
- If you hit "Leave Battlefield", your troops will be instantly healed, but there's a catch:
you will be locked out of rejoining the event for 12 minutes. This is still a better deal than healing up in match
- Once you leave there will be a 12 min timer and you will only be able to rejoin once this has counted down
- It is expected that the attack team will need to take 12 min time outs to heal up to full strength again

## Burning cities
- This is a good strategy in this event!
- A city burned to zero durability will get automatically teleported to the safe zone,
but this is not the same thing as leaving the battlefield for the 12 min cooldown so no troops will be healed
- Taking out the opposition players so they have no troops left will disable them and open us up for the win

## Troops and Heroes
- You are either attacking or defending (depending on your team role). Read the [rallies page](/rallies) for more details
- If you are an attack leader just rally with your strongest heroes like you would do for the bear
- As an attack joiner, join rallies with Chenko
- In either case, attackers should use a 50%/20%/30% troop mix. Save a formation to make sure you get it right
- If you are a garrison leader just send your strongest heroes
- As a garrison support, send Gordon or Howard (or other defensive hero)
- In either case, defenders should use a 60%/20%/20% troop mix. Save a formation to make sure you get it right

## Teams Strategy

### Setting Up
- Divide into three teams of roughly one third each: Attackers, Support & Defenders.
The defenders then get split into two sub-teams: Defenders 1 (Royal Stables) & Defenders 2 (Bell Tower)
- Strongest player goes into the Support team
- Next strongest players (8 to 10 depending on turn-out) all go into the Attack team.
Attack teamâ€™s job is to reduce enemy troop numbers, which makes it easier for others to take and hold buildings
- Next strongest players (7 to 9 depending on turn-out) all go into the Support team, with our top dog
- Remaining players (8 to 10 depending on turn-out) all go into the Defenders team
- Any subs should join the defenders teams, when they can get in
- Have four group chats set up, one for each team.
There should be a leader of each team who calls that team's strategy throughout the match

### Defender Team 1 (Royal Stables)
- The point of the defenders team is to garrison buildings.
Since you lose you garrisoned troops if you teleport, the defenders team are expected to stay in one spot for the whole match
- At the start of the match all teleport to the Royal Stables (bottom right on the map)
- As soon as you get there, send solo marches into the Stables to capture it ASAP
- Secondary targets are the Sanctuary & Abbey to the north and the Abbey to the west
- Send out marches to the secondary targets (without teleporting!) right after the Stables.
Send as many as you can spare but if troops are limited prioritise the Sancuary to the north
- You will need to be in contact with the Support team, whose job it is to support you.
They can help rally buildings controlled by the opposition & reinforce your castles when attacked
- Given the Stables is the high priority building, expect the support team to come with you to the Stables at the start
- At 15 minutes, when the Hall of Reformation opens up, the Supprt team will attack and win the building but you will need to garrison it
- If any of your buildings are attacked, make sure you re-garrison them
- At 30:00, 40:00 and 50:00 be on the look out for undercellars and raid them for extra points

### Defender Team 2 (Bell Tower)
- The point of the defenders team is to garrison buildings.
Since you lose you garrisoned troops if you teleport, the defenders team are expected to stay in one spot for the whole match
- At the start of the match all teleport to the Bell Tower (top left on the map)
- As soon as you get there, send solo marches into the Bell Tower to capture it ASAP
- Secondary targets are the Sanctuary & Abbey to the south and the Abbey to the east
- Send out marches to the secondary targets (without teleporting!) right after the Bell Tower.
Send as many as you can spare but if troops are limited prioritise the Sancuary to the south
- You will need to be in contact with the Support team, whose job it is to support you.
They can help rally buildings controlled by the opposition & reinforce your castles when attacked
- At 15 minutes, when the Mercenary Camp opens up, you will need to try to win and garrison it.
You may have help from the Support team although the priority is the Hall of Reformation at the same time
- Once you have the Mercenary Camp, use it to attack any building controlled by the opposition
- If any of your buildings are attacked, make sure you re-garrison them
- At 30:00, 40:00 and 50:00 be on the look out for undercellars and raid them for extra points

### Support Team
- The toughest team to be on in the match! You guys are literally match winners
- Your purpose is to support the defenders teams to win buildings and reinforce them if they are attacked
- Since you will teleport around the map, do not garrison buildings.
If you are in there after winning a battle, let the defenders garrison in and then recall your troops
- You will need to keep an eye on both defenders teams and be with the team that needs the most support
- Only attack in 1 min rallies, which will be called by your leader
- You can only teleport once every 5 minutes (hopefully),
so make sure there is 5 mins of useful stuff to do in each new location you move to
- If cities are being attacked directly, reinforce them
- At 15 minutes, when the Hall of Reformation opens up, attack and win it.
Wait for the Royal Stable defenders to garrison and then do the same with the Mercenary Camp
- If (when) the attack team has lost too many troops to be effective they will take a 12 min timeout to re-heal.
You will switch roles at this point and become the attack team, while they are out of the game. Read below for attack team role

### Attack Team
- Your purpose is to take out the opposition players, by directly attacking their castles
Target the strongest players first as they can do the most damage
- The squad must stay together and follow the team leader to each new teleport location, 
which will be near our attack targets
- In order to be effective, we will need to rally to attack players.
If a full attack team rally hits even a whale they are quite likely to take heavy losses
- Rallies to be called by the team lead with others joining
- We can experiment with calling two (or more) rallies at the same time,
I'm unsure if this will leave us more exposed or not so this strategy is tbd
- Should a full rally not succeed, don't keep rallying that player: we will just end up using up our attack team.
Move onto a weaker player, one whale will not win against a full team of us, so it is ok to leave them
- We can only teleport once every 5 minutes (hopefully) so once in a spot make sure we keep attacking all the
players in the vicinity
- We may well get attacked back, so be on the lookout and reinforce other castles when attacks come in
- If our troop numbers get too low, we will no longer be effective,
the attack team should take a 12 min cooldown when this happens, and the support team will switch in for this time and become the attack team


### Swordshrine battle
- Once the rest of the map is under control, the Attack team and Support team should both teleport to the center to take the Swordshrine
- It has been suggested (in an online guide) that this can wait till the last 10 minutes of the match.
This seems a little late to me but if it keeps the opposition away from every other building then maybe it works
- The Attack team and Support team should use co-ordinated rallies (one attack team rally, one support team rally) to attack the swordshrine at the same time
- The just garrison out for the rest of the match to take the win!

## General Strategy
- Only sign up if you are sure you will show at the allotted time. No shows are costly for the team
- Make sure your troops are not marching, healing, and reinforcing before starting
- Use labels on the map to co-ordinate everyone
- Use teams, to give people a role in the battle
- Have one person in charge of comms, setting new markers and keeping an eye on the time for transitions.
They can be less active in the fight. If using teams, make this a defender
- You can teleport around the map, these are limited but you get more through the battle.
The holding the stables helps with this
- You can attack other players and the buildings
- Garrison the important buildings to help hold them
- There are mines that pop up randomly on the map. Get them, they are useful
- Troop losses are a big issue in this game, batch healing does not work here
- If your troops are wiped, you can retreat and come back after 12 minutes to get them all back
