# Bear Pit

Scheduled every 2 days (time TBC, so look for messages and map markers). Half an hour of non-stop rallying.

## Strategy
- You need to be by the bear pit
- Call Rallies with your highest &amp; best troops. Use your three best heroes
- Join any other rallies with other troops
- You will get a higher score if you rally with the higher powered players, as your troops will get their hero and gear boosts
- **Join other rallies with Chenko** (or Amadeus) in the first slot, **or send no heroes at all**.
This will ensure that all rallies get the max lethality stack they can, which is the most important stat for this event.
You send no heroes to other rallies as they contribute nothing, but might prevent a Chenko hero skill from being added to the rally
- Save a Chenko-led formation so you have it ready to go, when picking troops to send to join a rally
- You will have time to call 5 rallies in the half hour, if you re-rally as soon as your rally squad returns
- If you have more troops than space in all your march queues, favour sending archers over other troop types as they have higher attack stats
