# Sanctuary Battle

Fight for control for 12 sanctuaries, and 4 forts. The forts are more prestigeous and will attract the biggest alliances.
With each change of control a half hour timer will be started. Keep control for half an hour continously and the sanctuary
or fort is ours!

## Strategy
- This is often arranged before the event with other big alliances, so that we don't lose troops fighting each other
- Even where it is not, we will have a list before the event of which we are going for. Note that this may not be the same list as
the game says since we have to sign up for sanctuaries a few days before, but negotiations on who gets what can go right up
to the wire
- **Make sure you know what our plan is, and stick to it** - no random rallies or solo attacks
- For uncontested sanctuaries, a small squad (~4) of weaker players should teleport next to the sanctuary. You can attack the sanctuary
directly (assuming your squad attack power is greater than 10.5m) to occupy. All 4 players should then garrison the sanctuary and 
wait out the half hour timer. If someone comes in to attack, this can change into contested
- For contested sanctuaries, we will be fighting other alliances. This is a bit more complicated
- If another clan has the sanctuary, we must call rallies. No solo attacks.
Only the strongest players should call rallies and everyone else joins those
- Keep rallying and attacking until we win through, or it becomes obvious we won't win and we retreat
- Once we're in, we need to garrison with the strongest troops we have. Do not garrison with anything less than your top ranked troops
Space in the sanctuary is limited so if there is a stronger player outside with better troops, recall to make space for them.
Keeping the sanctuary fully garrisoned is the first priority though so if there's space and no one else to fill it, send lower troops to fill.
- While garrisoned, you will lose troops to attacks. You can replenish them by sending in new troops to garrison. You do not need to recall 
troops first for this to work, it will just top the already garrisoned troops up
- You will get a lot of troops injured in a contested fight. Make sure you are [healing correctly](/healing)
