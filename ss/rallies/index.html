  <h1>Rallies and Garrisoning Guide</h1>
  <p>
    This page talks about rallies but garrisons are effectivly exactly the same thing and most of this 
	advice applies interchangably. There is a section at the bottom for garrison specific considerations

    TL;DR? <a href="#strategy">Go straight to the strategy</a>

  <h2>What affects Rally strength?</h2>
  <p>
    A rally is made up of troops, stat bonuses and hero skills. Maximising these is the key to running
	an effective rally.
    <ul>
	  <li>
	    The stats of the rally leader (the person who called the rally) are by far the most important.
		The governor gear, research levels, hero skills all boost Attack / Defense / Leathality / Health
        of the troops and <em>these only come from the rally leader</em>.		
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Heroes also have skills which can boost the effctiveness of the attack. On the skills page of the hero
        there are two types of skill: Conquest (on the left) and Expedition (on the right). Only the Expedition
        skills matter, conquest is for things like the arena. The best boosts are those that improve Lethality
        and health and/or affect the entire squad. Gold heroes tend to have better skills		
	  </li>

        </div>
      </div>
	  <li>
	    If you are joining someone else's rally, then the four of the joiners will contribute one hero skill, in
		addition to the rally leader's 9 (3 expedition skills from 3 heroes). The hero skill that is contributed
		is the top (right) expedition skill, of the first hero (leftmost of the three in the send rally page).
		The four are determined by who joined first, but later joiners can bump out the first joiners if they have
		a higher level skill in the top left slot
	  </li>

          <img src="/assets/img/top-left-skill.webp" alt="Top left skill" />
        </div>
      </div>
	  <li>
	    The rally leader also determines the squad size (increased by upgrading the Command Centre in town)
        of how many additional troops can be sent by other players. Naturally higher level troops are better than low
		level troops
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Troop composition can also make a difference as the different troop types have different strengths and weaknesses
	  </li>

  <h2 id="strategy">Rally strategy</h2>
  <p>
    This applies only for the strongest battles. Rallying for a Terror? Do what you like :)
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  Only let the strongest player call rallies. If it is really serious, maybe coordinate multiple rallies but this is
      advanced and rarely needed	  
	</li>
	<li>
	  Have the strongest player teleported as close to the attact target as possible, for shorter marches
	</li>
	<li>
	  Listen to rally guidance, we may have an only T9+ troops requirment. Do not send any troops below T8
	</li>
	<li>
	  Only send as many troops as you have room in your infirmary, to make sure you don't lose any troops in a wipe-out.
	  Be ready to <a href="/healing">batch heal</a> to quickly get back on your feet
	</li>
	<li>
	  Preferably, send Chenko or Amadeus as your first support hero for the lethality boost
	</li>
	<li>
	  Listen to rally guidance on troop composition. We might want a specific mix of troops sent
	</li>
  </ul>
