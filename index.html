  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We try to stay neutral and friendly with all alliances</li>
    <li>Don't get into arguments on world chat. If you can't help it just stay away, you're not missing anything</li>
    <li>Do not attack other players unless very clearly directed to do so by an R4. This includes city raids, resource tile hitting and destroying banners. This is how wars start!</li>
    <li>Help each other. We succeed together</li>
  </ul>
