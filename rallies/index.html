  <h1>Rallies and Garrisoning Guide</h1>
  <p>
    This page talks about rallies but garrisons are effectivly exactly the same thing and most of this 
	advice applies interchangably. There is a section at the bottom for garrison specific considerations
  </p>
  <p>
    TL;DR? <a href="#summary">Go straight to the summary</a>
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>What affects Rally strength?</h2>
  <p>
    A rally is made up of troops, stat bonuses and hero skills. Maximising these is the key to running
	an effective rally.
    <ul>
	  <li>
	    The stats of the rally leader (the person who called the rally) are by far the most important.
		The governor gear, research levels, hero skills all boost Attack / Defense / Leathality / Health
        of the troops and <em>these only come from the rally leader</em>.		
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Heroes also have skills which can boost the effctiveness of the attack. On the skills page of the hero
        there are two types of skill: Conquest (on the left) and Expedition (on the right). Only the Expedition
        skills matter, conquest is for things like the arena. The best boosts are those that improve Lethality
        and health and/or affect the entire squad. Gold heroes tend to have better skills		
	  </li>
	  <div class="image-row">
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img src="/assets/img/expedition-skills.webp" alt="Expedition Skills" />
        </div>
      </div>
	  <li>
	    If you are joining someone else's rally, then the four of the joiners will contribute one hero skill, in
		addition to the rally leader's 9 (3 expedition skills from 3 heroes). The hero skill that is contributed
		is the top (right) expedition skill, of the first hero (leftmost of the three in the send rally page).
		The four are determined by who joined first, but later joiners can bump out the first joiners if they have
		a higher level skill in the top left slot
	  </li>
	  <div class="image-row">
        <div class="image-wrapper">
          <img src="/assets/img/first-hero.webp" alt="First hero" />
        </div>
		<div class="image-wrapper">
          <img src="/assets/img/top-left-skill.webp" alt="Top left skill" />
        </div>
      </div>
	  <li>
	    The rally leader also determines the squad size (increased by upgrading the Command Centre in town)
        of how many additional troops can be sent by other players. Naturally higher level troops are better than low
		level troops
	  </li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Don't believe me?</h2>
  <p>
    Well then, see for yourself:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  On the war page, click on the players to get to the rally details page	  
	</li>
	<li>
	  On the rally details page, note the top 4 joiners & their first hero
	</li>
	<li>
	  On the rally details page, click on the tiny (!!!), orange rally bonus button. It's on the right above all the player details
	</li>
	<div class="image-row">
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="/assets/img/war-page.webp" alt="War page" />
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="/assets/img/rally-details.webp" alt="Rally details" />
      </div>
    </div>
	<li>
	  On the rally bonus page you can see for certain what bonuses the rally is getting, it's all from the rally captain
	</li>
	<li>
	  On the rally bonus page at the bottom, you can see the first four joiners contributing their first skill
	</li>
	<div class="image-row">
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="/assets/img/rally-bonus-1.webp" alt="Rally bonus page (top)" />
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="/assets/img/rally-bonus-2.webp" alt="Rally bonus page (bottom)" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Troop composition</h2>
  <p>
    Another thing to consider is the balance of troops sent. There is a rock, paper, scissors effect going on in this game where:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  Archers > Infantry	  
	</li>
	<li>
	  Infantry > Cavalry
	</li>
	<li>
	  Cavalry > Archers
	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So if you are attacking someone that you can scout first, look to see if they have an unbalanced troop composition.
	If they, say, have an excess of archers, make sure that you send in more cavalry in your attack. You should always keep things
	a bit balanced and skew towards sending more infantry, as they have the highest health.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a serious battle, expect the rally leader to call the troop composition they want filled (both troop level and mix of troops)
	and make sure you stick to it
  </p>
  <p>
    You can adjust the default troop composition from the formations page, or just use the sliders on the troop counts each time
  </p>
  <div class="image-row">
    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img src="/assets/img/balance-button.webp" alt="Troop balance button" />
    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img src="/assets/img/troop-balance.webp" alt="Troop balancing" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Recommended troop balances:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  50% / 20% / 30% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (standard)  
	</li>
	<li>
	  60% / 20% / 20% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (more defensive)
	</li>
	<li>
	  10% / 10% / 80% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (for the bear only, since he doesn't attack back)
	</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Garrisoning</h2>
  <p>
    At the start I said that garrisoning is like rallying, and for the most part they are the same thing. We have a garrison leader,
	the one with the green flag next to them, who acts as the rally captain, providing all the buffs and most of the hero skills
  </p>
  <p>
    As the point of garrisoning is defense, defensive stats and skills are relativly more important. Look for boosting the squad
	health as a skill. Gordon, Jabel, Helga and Hilde are all good defensive heroes. If you have a Gordon with level 4 or 5 Super Nutrients skill, 
	he is a great pick
  </p>
  <p>
    As we are attacked, you will lose troops to injury. Make sure you are <a href="/healing">healing</a> them. You can replace
	injured troops in the garrison by sending a new squad in, the game will automatically only take as many troops as you and / or
	the building will fit, bouncing the rest back to you. Make sure you keep troop types balanced by only sending in the troop type you
	are low on, which will usually be infantry.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Troop losses and timed attacks</h2>
  <p>
    In each battle, the attackers and defenders take turns to attack each other. They all attack the other side's troops in order, going first
	infantry, then calvalry, then archers. All of the other side's infantry must be removed from battle before their cavalry is attacked, 
	and all the infantry and cavalry must be removed before archers are attacked. There is one exception to this, the cavalry have a 20% chance
	to skip the front lines and attack the archers directly, which they are super effective at killing once through. When one side has lost all
	its troops (to one of the three methods) the battle is over and the other side has won.
  </p>
  <p>
    Troops get removed from battle either as lightly injured (they are fine after the battle), seriously injured (they fill up the infirmary and
	if that is full, die) or losses (which means they die right away). You only get outright losses when attacking another player's city,
	and defending or attacking a level 4 alliance resource outpost. If you don't like losses, be careful of these situations. You can recover
	infirmary overflow losses at the enlistment office but it will cost you, so try to avoid if at all possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lightly injured troops are perhaps most relevant when garrisoning a building. These troops are removed from the building and sent back to your
	castle straight away, even though they are fine to re-use. This means that if two attacks come in in quick succession, the second attack will
	often face way fewer troops as the defenders will not have had the chance to re-garrison to replace their losses. This means two things, one
	re-garrisoning is very important in big battles where we are defending and, two if we are attacking a heavily fortified building we should call
	two (or more!) rallies to hit one after the other. Always remembering that it is the strongest players that must call the rallies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the order of which troops get attacked in battle, you will lose infantry in the highest numbers, then archers, and then finally cavalry.
	If you just re-garrison with an equal mix of troops, we will end up with too many cavalry in the building, which is then easily attacked with
	an infantry heavy attack. Keep an eye on troop levels and generally favour re-garrisoning with an 80% / 20% mix of infantry / archers as your
	default choice to keep the garrison troop levels in balance.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="summary">Rally summary</h2>
  <p>
    This applies only for the strongest battles. Rallying for a Terror? Do what you like :)
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  Only let the strongest player call rallies. If it is really serious, maybe coordinate multiple rallies	  
	</li>
	<li>
	  Have the strongest player teleported as close to the attact target as possible, for shorter marches
	</li>
	<li>
	  Listen to rally guidance, we may have an only T9+ troops requirment. Do not send any troops below T8
	</li>
	<li>
	  Only send as many troops as you have room in your infirmary, to make sure you don't lose any troops in a wipe-out.
	  Be ready to <a href="/healing">batch heal</a> to quickly get back on your feet
	</li>
	<li>
	  If attacking, preferably, send Chenko or Amadeus as your first support hero for the lethality boost
	</li>
	<li>
	  If defending, preferably, send Gordon as your first support hero for the health boost
	</li>
	<li>
	  Listen to rally guidance on troop composition. We might want a specific mix of troops sent.
	  Default mix is 50/20/30 infantry/cavalry/archers
	</li>
	<li>
	  Re-garrison buildings after attacks. Make sure you keep the troop numbers in balacne
	</li>
  </ul>
