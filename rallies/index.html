  <h1>Rallies and Garrisoning Guide</h1>
  <p>
    This page talks about rallies but garrisons are effectivly exactly the same thing and most of this 
    advice applies interchangably. There is a section at the bottom for garrison specific considerations

  <h2 id="rally-strength">What affects Rally strength?</h2>
  <p>
    A rally is made up of troops, stat bonuses and hero skills. Maximising these is the key to running
    an effective rally.
    <ul>
	  <li>
	    The stats of the rally leader (the person who called the rally) are by far the most important.
      The governor gear, research levels, hero skills all boost Attack / Defense / Leathality / Health
      of the troops and <em>these only come from the rally leader</em>.		
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Heroes also have skills which can boost the effctiveness of the attack. On the skills page of the hero
      there are two types of skill: Conquest (on the left) and Expedition (on the right). Only the Expedition
      skills matter, conquest is for things like the arena. The best boosts are those that improve Lethality
      and health and/or affect the entire squad. Gold heroes tend to have better skills		
	  </li>
	  <div class="image-row">
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="/assets/img/expedition-skills.webp" alt="Expedition Skills" />
      </div>
      </div>
	  <li>
	    If you are joining someone else's rally, then the four of the joiners will contribute one hero skill, in
      addition to the rally leader's 9 (3 expedition skills from 3 heroes). The hero skill that is contributed
      is the top (right) expedition skill, of the first hero (leftmost of the three in the send rally page).
      The four are determined by who joined first, but later joiners can bump out the first joiners if they have
      a higher level skill in the top left slot
	  </li>
    <div class="image-row">

      </div>
    </div>
	  <li>
      The rally leader also determines the squad size (increased by upgrading the Command Centre in town)
      of how many additional troops can be sent by other players. Naturally higher level troops are better than low
      level troops

  <h2 id="heroes">Effect of Heroes</h2>
  <h3>Rally Leader</h3>
  <p>
    As set out in the previous sections, if you are the rally leader (the one who called the rally) then all three of your heroes
    count towards rally stats. If you had not noticed, you can only have one hero of each troop type and generally they boost their
    troop type only.
    In particular, the following hero effects apply <strong>for the rally leader only</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The level of the hero will increase the attack and defense of the associated troop type
      </li>
      <li>
        The level of the hero gear will increase the lethality (helm &amp; greaves) and health (gloves &amp; shroud ) of the 
        associated troop type. Forge hammer enhancement provides a further, multiplicative boost to the gear level stats
      </li>
      <li>
        The hero expedtion skills (right side only) are all applied. If using mythic (gold) heroes this will mean 3 skills per 
        hero, for a total of 9 skills. These are not necessarily limited to the associated troop type. Some skills are offensive 
        and some are defensive.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using mythic (gold) heroes, and they have a hero widget equipped, then these will also apply. These boost lethality and 
        health of the associated troop type.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using mythic (gold) heroes, and they have a hero widget equipped, then they also have a skill. You can run up to three of these therefore but be aware the skills are often situational and might not apply to every rally, for example Zoe's widget skills only apply when she is garrisoning (and the player is garrison lead)
      </li>
      <li>
        Each hero increases your squad capacity, for how many troops you can contribute to the rally. This increases with hero level. It does not affect total rally capacity though, which is determined by the rally leader's Command Center level, so a small rally leader squad just means more space for rally joiners
      </li>
    </ul>
    For completeness, these hero boosts get added to the following other sources of stats
    <strong>for the rally leader only</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Governor gear boosts attack and defense. Different pieces boost different troop types
      </li>
      <li>
        Governor charms boost lethality and health. Different pieces boost different troop types
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are running any buffs (e.g. from the King's appointment or from the City Bonus page), these will be applied
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly if your opponent is running any debuffs, these will be also applied. I realise this is not a rally leader thing 
        but it's not a rally joiner stat either and it goes with the point above
      </li>
    </ul>
    These all get combined into the Squad Bonus (via Captain) section of the Rally Bonus
  </p>
  <h3>Rally Joiner</h3>
  <p>
    If you are not the rally leader, then heroes only affect the rally joiner's squad size (same effect as for the rally 
    leader). In addition, you <em>might</em> contribute one hero skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned in a previous section, the first 4 joiners to any rally will contribute thier top left skill to the rally. If 
    someone joins the rally after the first 4 and has a higher level skill then they will replace the lower skill with their higher 
    level skill. If you join with a level 5 skill, which is the max, you will never get bumped out even it is a purple hero skill 
    and the later joiner has a gold hero
  </p>
  <p>
    So now we need to look at these top-left skills. These skills are either percentage chance based or a passive bonus. <strong>
    Always favour the passive bonuses</strong> as multiple copies of the same skill stack. Also hero skills are either offensive or 
    defensive. Favour the one that suits your situation. The next section lists out the different hero skills, so you can better 
    plan who your #1 joining hero should be
  </p>
  <h3>Hero Skills</h3>.
  <strong>Offensive</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Chenko</strong> (passive) - Chenko implements advanced weaponry for our soldiers, increasing the total Squads’ Lethality by 25%
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Amadeus</strong> (passive) - Young ranger Amadeus excels in boosting morale, increasing the total Squads’ Lethality by 25%
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Marlin</strong> (chance) - Marlin, being unpredictable, has a 40% chance of increasing damage dealt by 50% for all squads
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Zoe</strong> (chance) - Your squads’ attacks gain a 20% chance of inflicting Sunder, dealing 40% damage per turn for 3 turns
    </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Defensive</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Gordon</strong> (passive) - Gordon's culinary masterpieces invigorate our soldiers, increasing total Squad's Health by 25%
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Saul</strong> (passive) - As a member of the task force, Saul’s unique training program is highly empowering, increasing the total Squads’ Defense and Health by 10% and 15%.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Quinn</strong> (passive) - Senses danger ahead, reducing damage taken by 20% for all troops
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Howard</strong> (passive) - Howard guards our troops with his shield, reducing damage taken by 20% for all troops
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jabel</strong> (chance) - Jabel with her banner-like red armor, has a 40% chance of reducing damage taken by 50% for all squads
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Helga</strong> (chance) - Helga has a 40% chance of reducing damage taken by 50% for all squads
    </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Offensive &amp; Defensive</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hilde</strong> (passive) - Hilde’s exhaustive discipline develops soldiers into true weapons, increasing the total squads’ Attack and Defense by 15% and 10%
    </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Other</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Diana</strong> (passive) - The unique arts of the wilderness rangers reduce Governor Stamina Cost by 20%
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The blue heroes all have farming related skills, which have no effect on rallies</p>
  <p>
    In summary, you really want Chenko (or Amadeus) as the lead hero for most offensvie rallies, and you want Gordon (or Saul) for 
    defensive situations. Hilde is an ok mix between the two types. Unfortunately most players are likely to have Jabel as their 
    most powerful and upgraded hero, which is who the game will default pick, but she is a bad pick for a #1 hero to join a rally 
    being a chance based defensive hero
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="troops">Troop composition</h2>
  <p>
    Another thing to consider is the balance of troops sent. There is a rock, paper, scissors effect going on in this game where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Archers > Infantry	  
    </li>
    <li>
      Infantry > Cavalry
    </li>
    <li>
      Cavalry > Archers
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So if you are attacking someone that you can scout first, look to see if they have an unbalanced troop composition.
    If they, say, have an excess of archers, make sure that you send in more cavalry in your attack. You should always keep things
    a bit balanced and skew towards sending more infantry, as they have the highest health.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a serious battle, expect the rally leader to call the troop composition they want filled (both troop level and mix of troops)
    and make sure you stick to it
  </p>
  <p>
    You can adjust the default troop composition from the formations page, or just use the sliders on the troop counts each time
  </p>
  <div class="image-row">

    </div>
    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img src="/assets/img/troop-balance.webp" alt="Troop balancing" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Recommended troop balances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      50% / 20% / 30% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (standard)  
    </li>
    <li>
      60% / 20% / 20% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (more defensive)
    </li>
    <li>
      10% / 10% / 80% - Infantry / Cavalry / Archers (for the bear only, since he doesn't attack back)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="garrisoning">Garrisoning</h2>
  <p>
    At the start I said that garrisoning is like rallying, and for the most part they are the same thing. We have a garrison leader,
    the one with the green flag next to them, who acts as the rally captain, providing all the buffs and most of the hero skills
  </p>
  <p>
    As the point of garrisoning is defense, defensive stats and skills are relativly more important. Look for boosting the squad
    health as a skill. Gordon, Jabel, Helga and Hilde are all good defensive heroes. If you have a Gordon with level 4 or 5 Super Nutrients skill, he is a great pick
  </p>
  <p>
    As we are attacked, you will lose troops to injury. Make sure you are <a href="/healing">healing</a> them. You can replace
    injured troops in the garrison by sending a new squad in, the game will automatically only take as many troops as you and / or
    the building will fit, bouncing the rest back to you. Make sure you keep troop types balanced by only sending in the troop type 
    you are low on, which will usually be infantry.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="troop-losses">Troop losses and timed attacks</h2>
  <p>
    In each battle, the attackers and defenders take turns to attack each other. They all attack the other side's troops in order, 
    going first infantry, then calvalry, then archers. All of the other side's infantry must be removed from battle before their 
    cavalry is attacked, and all the infantry and cavalry must be removed before archers are attacked. There is one exception to 
    this, the cavalry have a 20% chance to skip the front lines and attack the archers directly, which they are super effective at 
    killing once through. When one side has lost all its troops (to one of the three methods) the battle is over and the other side 
    has won.
  </p>
  <p>
    Troops get removed from battle either as lightly injured (they are fine after the battle), seriously injured (they fill up the 
    infirmary and if that is full, die) or losses (which means they die right away). You only get outright losses when attacking 
    another player's city, and defending or attacking a level 4 alliance resource outpost. If you don't like losses, be careful of 
    these situations. You can recover infirmary overflow losses at the enlistment office but it will cost you, so try to avoid if 
    at all possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lightly injured troops are perhaps most relevant when garrisoning a building. These troops are removed from the building and  
    sent back to your castle straight away, even though they are fine to re-use. This means that if two attacks come in in quick 
    succession, the second attack will often face way fewer troops as the defenders will not have had the chance to re-garrison to 
    replace their losses. This means two things, one re-garrisoning is very important in big battles where we are defending and, 
    two if we are attacking a heavily fortified building we should call two (or more!) rallies to hit one after the other. Always 
    remembering that it is the strongest players that must call the rallies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the order of which troops get attacked in battle, you will lose infantry in the highest numbers, then archers, and then 
    finally cavalry. If you just re-garrison with an equal mix of troops, we will end up with too many cavalry in the building, 
    which is then easily attacked with an infantry heavy attack. Keep an eye on troop levels and generally favour re-garrisoning 
    with an 80% / 20% mix of infantry / archers as your default choice to keep the garrison troop levels in balance.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="summary">Rally summary</h2>
  <p>
    This applies only for the strongest battles. Rallying for a Terror? Do what you like :)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Only let the strongest player call rallies. If it is really serious, maybe coordinate multiple rallies	  
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the strongest player teleported as close to the attack target as possible, for shorter marches
    </li>
    <li>
      Listen to rally guidance, we may have an only T9+ troops requirment. Do not send any troops below T8
    </li>
    <li>
      Only send as many troops as you have room in your infirmary, to make sure you don't lose any troops in a wipe-out.
      Be ready to <a href="/healing">batch heal</a> to quickly get back on your feet
    </li>
    <li>
      If attacking, preferably, send Chenko as your first support hero for the passive lethality boost
    </li>
    <li>
      If defending, preferably, send Gordon as your first support hero for the health boost
    </li>
    <li>
      Listen to rally guidance on troop composition. We might want a specific mix of troops sent.
      Default mix is 50/20/30 infantry/cavalry/archers
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-garrison buildings after attacks. Make sure you keep the troop numbers in balacne
    </li>
  </ul>
