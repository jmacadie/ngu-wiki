  <h1>Events</h1>

  <h2>Bear Pit</h2>
  <p>
    Scheduled every 2 days (time TBC, so look for messages and map markers). Half an hour of non-stop rallying.
  </p>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You need to be by the bear pit to take part</li>
    <li>Call Rallies with your highest &amp; best troops</li>
    <li>Join any other rallies with other troops, look for the rallies with shortest time to get more rallies</li>
	<li>Send troops back out as soon as they come back in</li>
	<li>If you have more troops than space in all your march queues, favour sending archers over other troop types as they have higher attack stats</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Viking's Vengeance</h2>
  <p>
    20 Waves of attacks from Vikings that get increasingly strong. Every player is attacked in each wave, bar 10 and 20
    Waves 10 and 20 will attack the plains HQ. If you are defeated in any two rounds, you are out and the vikings will
	no longer attack you
  </p>
  <h3>Before the event</h3>
  <ul>
	<li>Strategy is to send out all your troops, except your 3 best heros</li>
	<li>Make your strongest squad 62k troops + heroes and send to reinforce a friend</li>
	<li>Divide your remaining troops evenly between the number of march queues you have left</li>
	<li>Send out these remaining troops to reinforce other castles</li>
	<li>Aim is to get 200k troops in every castle, so if you have too many expell some and if you have too few ask on alliance chat</li>
	<li>Everyone should have at least one lot of T8 or T9 troops to ensure proper defence</li>
	<li>R4s will check before the event that troop distribution is ok</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>During the event</h3>
  <ul>
	<li>DO NOT HEAL YOUR TROOPS. It's odd advice but it messes up the points allocation</li>
	<li>After you are certain waves 9 and 19 have made their attack on your first friend, recall just that squad</li>
	<li>Once back home, send it out to the HQ to garrison. Not everyone will be able to fit</li>
	<li>After you are certain waves 10 and 20 have made their attack on the HQ (be aware they are slow!) you can recall your troops from the HQ</li>
	<li>For wave 11, send your squad back to the friend you recalled them from so that they have the same cover for waves 11 to 19</li>
	<li>If you are defeated twice, expell all garrisoned troops from your castle so that players can send them out to protect castles that are still in</li>
	<li>After all waves are over, recall your troops and we can get <a href="/healing">batch healing</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Alliance Championship</h2>
  <p>
    An auto-attacker battle against another clan. We move up and down leagues based on results, so will gradually meet bigger and better clans
  </p>
  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Not much for you to do other than register for the event!</li>
	<li>Having good troops and heroes helps, so keep training all the time</li>
	<li>For the R4s the rough plan is to stack more attacking power onto two columns and hope that they win, as we only need win two out of three corridors to win the match</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Swordland Showdown</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A mini-battle against another clan in a private map, over half an hour</li>
    <li>We can have up to two legions fighting at the same time</li>
    <li>You can teleport around the map, these are limited but you get more through the battle</li>
    <li>You can attack other players and the buildings</li>
    <li>Win the buildings and hold them to gain points</li>
    <li>Garrison the important buildings to help hold them</li>
    <li>There are mines that pop up randomly on the map. Get them, they are useful</li>
    <li>If you hold a building rebels will also attack you and weaken the garrisoned troops</li>
    <li>Troop losses are a big issue in this game, effective healing is an important aspect</li>
    <li>idk about this one really, it's a bit of a free for all every time I've done it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Eternity's Reach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mine mines, there are three levels</li>
    <li>You will need to defeat rebels to get to the mines</li>
    <li>A quiet area of the map is good to avoid competition. Use your teleports wisely</li>
  </ul>
