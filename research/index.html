  <h1>Research Planner</h1>

  <p>
    This page comes in three parts
  </p>
  <p>
    1️⃣ At the top of the page, you can use the filters to show a list of researches in the first table below.
    Use this to record what your current research levels are. The buttons are useful to bulk MAX a whole load
    of researches at the same time
  </p>
  <p>
    2️⃣ Next there is a Stats section. In this section, input your research speed (from the Academy details) and your
    current academy level. With this, the page will calculate three different tables:
  <ul>
    <li>
      a table summarising what you have researched to date (the stats of which should be the same as the summary
      table you can pull up in the academy)
    </li>
    <li>
      a table summarising the outstanding research at your current academy level
    </li>
    <li>
      a further table that shows you the full horror of the 10 years research you have ahead of you
    </li>
  </ul>
    All the times shown are in your current research speed, as you continue to research 'Tool Enhancement' these times will
    come down
  </p>
  <p>
    3️⃣ Finally, there is a recommended next research section ... or there will be! I've not built it yet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  </p>
