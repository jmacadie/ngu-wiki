  <h1>Healing Troops</h1>

  <p>In the infirmary, you don't need to heal all troops at once. Adjust down the sliders and you will heal fewer troops.</p>

  <p>Why do that? Well, once a heal is underway you can request help from allies to speed that healing session.</p>
  <p>By batching up heal sessions into groups that can be fully helped by allies, you can instantly heal <em>any</em> amount of troops.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Go to your Embassy and click on <strong>Details</strong> and look for <strong>Ally Assists</strong> and <strong>Ally Help Time</strong>. This is how much help you can get for each request.

  <p>The black numbers are your base levels and the green numbers are additions from research. You need to add the two together.</p>

    than this immediate help number &amp; revel in the power of instant healing ... or shout at your team-mates to assist!
